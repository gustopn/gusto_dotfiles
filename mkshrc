# The biggest issue here is how PS1 looks, this can be complicated
# first we need to set HOSTNAME, because we do not have that per default

# then we have a problem also with the mksh handling some keybindings and encoding wrong
# we force on it UTF-8
set -o utf8-mode
# and fix keybinding for clearing the screen
