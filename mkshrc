# The biggest issue here is how PS1 looks, this can be complicated
# first we need to set HOSTNAME, because we do not have that per default
HOSTNAME=`hostname -s`
# and then this does not check if we are root or not, so only use this for users.
PS1="[\$USER@$HOSTNAME:\$PWD]$ "
# that can be left that way since we do not ever want to change root shell, use sudo instead!
